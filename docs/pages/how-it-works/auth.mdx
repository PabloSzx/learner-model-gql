# Auth

## Authentication

The authentication process uses the external service [Auth0](https://auth0.com/),
this couples perfectly with the microservices architecture of the project, giving out-of-the-box traditional Email+Password authentication,
and enables easier integration with social connections,
like [Google / Gmail](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/google-social-connection) and
[Microsoft Accounts](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/microsoft-account-social-connection),
which are the currently enabled connections, and with further subscription plans, has the potential
for integration with [Google Workspace](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/google-workspace-sso) and
[Office 365](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/office-365-sso).

### Auth0

One of the best advantages of using Auth0 is that it makes its usage easier for both client-side and server-side.

#### Client side

For client-side, and more specifically in [learner-model-gql-template](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql-template),
the project uses the **auth0-react** library, the source code, and lower-level documentation is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react),
meanwhile, the higher level documentation is available in the [Auth0 Website](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-react).

Other than configuring the Auth0 integration in [manage.auth0.com](https://manage.auth0.com/), to re-use the existing integration already created and available,
a couple of basic configurations on the client-side of the project have to be done, for example, setting, for example, the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=learner-model-gql.us.auth0.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=RRfBLJvPlx2R6opfhYqGSb23oh7vZUFx
```

And the Auth0 Provider of **auth0-react** as it follows:

```tsx
<Auth0Provider
  domain={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN!}
  clientId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID!}
  redirectUri={
    typeof window !== "undefined" ? window.location.origin : undefined
  }
>
  ...
</Auth0Provider>
```

The service expects the raw token in the `authorization` header, with the prefix `Bearer`, something like:

```ts
({
  headers: {
    authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

#### Server side

On the server-side, the services use the plugin [fastify-auth0-verify](https://github.com/nearform/fastify-auth0-verify), which
given the `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT` and `AUTH0_SECRET` secret environment variables, it decodes the authorization token provided in the `authorization` header,
and the services can identify the authenticated user.

## Authorization

The authorization process relies on the local [database](/how-it-works/database) user modeling,
by using the "email" field provided by Auth0 and connecting the Auth0's uid to a local database user.

After the services have access to the "user" entity, they check the user's projects (including projects of the user's groups) compared to the requested project's data.

The majority of the logic of the authorization rules are shared between all the services and defined in [/packages/api-base/src/auth.ts](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/blob/main/packages/api-base/src/auth.ts),
many of them described as Lazy [JavaScript Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), based on where they are [awaited](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) in the respective resolver.

A couple examples of the mentioned authorization checkers is the `expectUser` and `expectAdmin` rule, which are defined as:

```ts
const expectUser = LazyPromise(async () => {
  const user = await userPromise;

  assert(user, "Forbidden!");

  return user;
});

const expectAdmin = LazyPromise(async () => {
  const user = await expectUser;

  assert(user.role === "ADMIN", "Forbidden");

  return user;
});
```

The `expectUser` checks that the authenticated user entity exists, and the `expectAdmin` re-uses the `expectUser` rule and asserts that the user also has the role `ADMIN`.
