# Architecture

Learner Model GQL follows a [Microservices architecture style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices) while leveraging [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), the client-side of the project interacts with a single GraphQL API gateway,
which orchestrates the different GraphQL microservices based on the request query.

## Schema Stitching

The GraphQL services design and API gateway rely on schema stitching, using the [GraphQL Tools](https://www.graphql-tools.com/) library [@graphql-tools/stitch](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-stitching/stitch-combining-schemas).

Some critical designs to be followed to do the schema stitching are:

- Every entity to be extended by more than a single service needs a unique "id" field
- Every service that extends an entity needs a standardized query that accepts a list of ids and returns a list of the requested entities in the same order as the "ids" parameter. If any of the requested entities is not found, the query must fail.
