# Architecture

Learner Model GQL follows a [Microservices architecture style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices) while leveraging [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), the client-side of the project interacts with a single GraphQL API gateway,
which orchestrates the different GraphQL microservices based on the request query.

## Schema Stitching

The GraphQL services design and API gateway rely on schema stitching, using the [GraphQL Tools](https://www.graphql-tools.com/) library [@graphql-tools/stitch](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-stitching/stitch-combining-schemas).

Some critical designs to be followed to do the schema stitching are:

- Every entity to be extended by more than a single service needs a unique "id" field
- Every service that extends an entity needs a standardized query that accepts a list of ids and returns a list of the requested entities in the same order as the "ids" parameter. If any of the requested entities is not found, the query must fail.

## Services

### Current services

- Actions | [packages/services/actions](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/tree/main/packages/services/actions)
- Content | [packages/services/content](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/tree/main/packages/services/content)
- Domain | [packages/services/domain](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/tree/main/packages/services/domain)
- Projects | [packages/services/projects](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/tree/main/packages/services/projects)
- State | [packages/services/state](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/tree/main/packages/services/state)
- Users | [packages/services/users](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/tree/main/packages/services/users)

### Ecosystem

All the services are currently made using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/),
but there isn't any specific requirement for new services to be made the same way, new GraphQL services could be made with different ecosystems,
like [Go](https://go.dev/) or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and just work by following the mentioned design constraints of `Schema Stitching`.

### Important libraries

- GraphQL EZ - [graphql-ez.com](https://www.graphql-ez.com/) - GraphQL API Framework, with support for multiple web frameworks and the latest GraphQL features.

  Which also relies on:
