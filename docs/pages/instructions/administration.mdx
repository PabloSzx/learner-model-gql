#### Topics

The `Topics` administration is divided by project, after specifying the project in the select, every topic associated with the project is showed:

Due to the possible associations between topics to create a hierarchy, every topic without "Parent" starts a new column of topics, in which, recursively, every topic is contained by it's parent.

When an existent topic is being edited, any change is saved when the `Save` button is pressed.

The hierarchy can be modified by changing the "Parent" of every topic, but allowing only changes that doesn't make a circular reference between topics hierarchy.

The `Create Topic` button works as expected, filtering the fields accordingly to the selected project.
