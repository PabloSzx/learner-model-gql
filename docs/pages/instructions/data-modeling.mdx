# Data modeling

## Schema

The data modeling of the project relies on **Prisma Schema**, you can check the prisma documentation in [https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema), and the schema of the project is in [packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/blob/main/packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma).

## Migration

The migrations for the data modeling relies on **Prisma Migrate**, you can check the prisma documentation in [https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate).

The prisma commands have to be executed from the [`packages/db`](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/tree/main/packages/db) directory.

## Client Usage

The **Prisma Client** usage is the core of the data modeling usage in the project, check the prisma documentation in [https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client).
