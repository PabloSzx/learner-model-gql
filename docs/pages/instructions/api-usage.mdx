# API Usage

For client usage of the API, simply point the GraphQL Endpoint to:

**`https://lm.inf.uach.cl/graphql`**.

As this project works is based on GraphQL, a statically typed schema is available, you can check it [here](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/blob/main/schema.gql).

You can also inspect interactively the schema using [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager) navigating to [`https://lm.inf.uach.cl/voyager`](https://lm.inf.uach.cl/voyager).

You can also use a web client called [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altair.sirmuel.design/), which allows you use the API directly with a user interface and experimenting and learning with useful development tools.

To automatically leverage the Auth0 authentication provided from the administration panel, its recommended to use the web GraphQL client through [`https://admin.lm.inf.uach.cl`](https://admin.lm.inf.uach.cl), and clicking on `Altair GraphQL Web Client`.
