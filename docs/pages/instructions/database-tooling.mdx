# Database tooling

## Scripts

Included database tooling scripts logic in available in [packages/db/scripts](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/tree/main/packages/db/scripts)

These scripts should be called through calling `pnpm scripts` while being inside the `packages/db` directory.

You can use `arrow keys ↑ ↓` to select the desired script, and press `Enter` to confirm the selection.

- [download-actions-csv.ts](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/blob/main/packages/db/scripts/download-actions-csv.ts)

This script does a basic `"get everything"` including `user` and `project` basic data, and creates a new `.csv` file, using [json2csv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2csv) to convert the json to csv seamlessly.

```ts
import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";
import json2csv from "json2csv";
import { prisma } from "../src";

const actions = await prisma.action.findMany({
  include: {
    user: {
      select: {
        email: true,
        name: true,
      },
    },
    project: {
      select: {
        code: true,
        label: true,
      },
    },
  },
});

const now = new Date().toISOString();

const csv = await json2csv.parseAsync(actions);

await writeFile(`./scripts_data/actions_${now}.csv`, csv, "utf-8");
```

The result is saved in the `scripts_data` directory, which should open automatically after the script is executed successfully.

- [download-actions-json.ts](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/blob/main/packages/db/scripts/download-actions-json.ts)

This script, just as `download-actions-csv`, does a basic `"get everything"` including `user` and `project` basic data, but creates a `.json` file instead, which might be more useful in certain environments or programmatic usage.

```ts
import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";
import { prisma } from "../src";

const actions = await prisma.action.findMany({
  include: {
    user: {
      select: {
        email: true,
        name: true,
      },
    },
    project: {
      select: {
        code: true,
        label: true,
      },
    },
  },
});

const now = new Date().toISOString();

await writeFile(
  `./scripts_data/actions_${now}.json`,
  JSON.stringify(actions, null, 2),
  "utf-8"
);
```

### Create your own script / Modify the existing scripts

You are completely free to create your own new scripts or modify the existing scripts based on your needs.

The `pnpm scripts` selection will automatically accept any new script file, the CLI logic code is available in [packages/db/run-scripts.ts](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql/blob/main/packages/db/run-scripts.ts).
