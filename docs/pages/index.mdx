# Learner Model GQL

Learner Model GQL is a project based on a [microservices architecture](/how-it-works/architecture) using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)

## Getting Started

### Installation

For development with learner-model-gql it is required to have installed:

- Node.js v16.x, which can be installed in different ways based on the platform, or you can visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for local database usage and testing, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) can be used in macOS or Windows
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system

### Development

This project requires [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), which is a dependency manager for Node.js, which you can install by following the instructions on [pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation).

> Assumming you already have access to the confidential Auth0 Credentials

1. Clone [`https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql`](https://github.com/PabloSzx/learner-model-gql)
2. Inside the cloned repository, run `pnpm i` to install all the required dependencies
3. Run `pnpm db:local`, this will start a local postgres database in the port `5789`, which can be used for development and its required for automated testing.
4. In the root of the cloned repository, an empty `.env` should be present, you have to manually modify it to look something like:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5789/postgres

   AUTH0_DOMAIN=learner-model-gql.us.auth0.com
   AUTH0_CLIENT=___
   AUTH0_SECRET=___

   ADMIN_USER_EMAIL=put_your_email_here@gmail.com
   ```

   The `AUTH0` environment variables have to changed based on the confidential credentials,
   the `DATABASE_URL` can be adapted to point to an external database if required,
   and `ADMIN_USER_EMAIL` should be changed to set the starting admin user.

5. After the local database is running and the `.env` is filled, run `pnpm migrate`, which will run the migrations on the local database.
6. Run `pnpm dev`. The gateway's [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altair.sirmuel.design/) is going to be available at [`http://localhost:8080/altair`](http://localhost:8080/altair),
   and administration client will be available at [`http://localhost:4010`](http://localhost:4010).
